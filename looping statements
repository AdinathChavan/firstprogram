----------Looping statements----------

1 - FOR loop -
  In for loop we just iterating the values we cannot use the iterated last value outside the loop.
2-  WHILE loop- 
  Logic should executed after checking the condition.
  In while loop we can use last iterated value in program hence while loop is used.
3- DO-WHILE loop -
  logic should executed before checking the condition.
  Just iterating like other loops
